LOC-Counter
===========

This is a project I did in software engineering that compares two CSharp files and determines how many lines of code were modified, added, or deleted.

The project uses some great algorithms that were implemented from a third party libary - open source of course. I also was experementing with IronRuby and Boo, so there are some extra projects involving those technologies inside this solution.
This is a Visual Stdudio project, and it has a reasonable little GUI built into it.
